## QS Optimisation Project Page  

This page contains the latest version of the optimisation webapp and the Excel macro. 

### What the project aims to achieve  
1. To reduce manual effort in identifying which campaigns need optimisation to improve campaign's quality score  
2. To reduce manual effort in identifying which keywords need optimisation  
3. To reduce manul effort in identifying which optimisation parameters will have highest impact on improving quality score  

*In future we will consider the same for Bid Optimisation as well*
